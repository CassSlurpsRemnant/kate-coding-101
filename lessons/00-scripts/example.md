## Running scripts

In this course, we will run simple scripts and get the output.

We will use node, which is a JavaScript runtime environment (JRE). It allows us to run JavaScript code on our computer.

In this folder, there is a file called `example.js`. When we run it, it will output the following 2 lines:

```
This is an example script.
It works!
```

We run in in the command line by doing the following steps:

**1.** Change directory to the `00-scripts` folder:

```bash
cd 00-scripts/
```

**2.** Run the script:

```bash

node example.js
```
