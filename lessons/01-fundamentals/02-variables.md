## Variables

Variables are pointers to values. You store data/information in a variable, so that you can acess it later.

**Example**

```js
// This stores my name. I can acess it later.
var name = "Daniel Farr";

// here is how I could access it.
console.log("I said that my name is: ", name);
// ouput: I said that my name is: Daniel Farr
```
