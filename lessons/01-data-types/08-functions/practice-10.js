/**
 * Challenge
 * Complete the code below so that it runs.
 *
 * Note: All function should be GLOBAL functions.
 *
 * 1. Make a function called add. It should take to numbers and return the sum.
 * 2. Make a function called subtract. It should take to numbers and return the difference.
 * 3. Make a function called multiply. It should take to numbers and return the product.
 * 4. Make a function called divide. It should take to numbers and return the quotient.
 * 5. Make a function called doMath. It should take three parameters:
 *    param 1: type - a string that represents the operation to be performed.
 *      - HINT: doMath will call the other math functions
 *    param 2, param 3 - two numbers to perform the operation on.
 *    return: the result of the operation.

/**
 * Add your code here

// If you build the functions correctly, this code will run correctly.
// Do not change anything below this line.
console.log("4 + 9 = ", doMath("add", 4, 9)); // 4 + 9 = 13
console.log("12 - 4 = ", doMath("subtract", 12, 4)); // 12 - 4 = 8
console.log("3 * 9 = ", doMath("multiply", 3, 9)); // 3 * 9 = 27
console.log("45 / 5 = ", doMath("divide", 45, 5)); // 45 / 5 = 9
